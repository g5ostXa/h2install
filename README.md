## h2install
**What is this?** \
This is the new installer for [`hyprarch2`](https://github.com/g5ostXa/hyprarch2).

Right now it is pretty bare bones, but does most of the heavy lifting, making the installation process much faster.

**How it works?** \
Simply have a fresh Arch install ready to be deployed, then follow the instructions on [`hyprarch2's`](https://github.com/g5ostXa/hyprarch2) README.
