## h2install
**What is this thing?** \
An installer for my [`hyprarch2`](https://github.com/g5ostXa/hyprarch2) project written in Go.

**What does it do?** \
Currently, the installer is pretty bare bones, but still does most of the heavy lifting. \
A [`bash install script`](https://github.com/g5ostXa/hyprarch2/blob/master/src/install.sh) is still used to manage simple tasks.

**How to use?** \
Simply have a minimal Arch base install and visit [`hyprarch2`](https://github.com/g5ostXa/hyprarch2).

> [!WARNING]
> This is meant to be used on upstream Arch, and was only tested on Arch.
